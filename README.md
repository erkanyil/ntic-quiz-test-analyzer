For the large educational organizations such as schools, training centre, universities
etc. optical marking system is preferred to use for exams. Optical Mark Reader
(OMR) machines speed up reading process for answer sheets. After getting the raw
output datasheet file from the OMR which is connected to the computer system,
particular software is needed to evaluate the exam and give the reports in specific
formats. In the case study for Nigerian Turkish Intâ€™l Colleges (NTIC) software has
been designed for analyzing raw datasheets for multiple choice tests. Software gives
accurate reports for all NTIC branches on time in order to reduce feedback time to
increase the efficiency of feedback.
